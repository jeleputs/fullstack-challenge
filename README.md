# Shiftmed fullstack code challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

- Implement a homepage with a grid of products that includes all the outstanding information for every product, 
  using [Material UI Card](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/#complex-interaction) for the front end
  and [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com/products) for retrieving the data
- Create a "Buy" button for each product and have a shopping cart, implementing a custom hook named
  `useStateWithStorage` with same API as `useState` hook but adding local storage capabilities.
- Implement an app header that displays the cart and persists on refresh

## Scripts
